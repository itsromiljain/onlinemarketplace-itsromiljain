# User Stories
The goal of this section is to explain how to use the application to evaluate the various user stories. 

#### Important 
	- You will need to refresh the page manually after a transaction has confirmed to see the updated state (ex: if creating a new storefront, wait for the transaction to confirm, refresh the page, and the created storefront will be displayed)
	- Most transactions (ex: creating a storefront, withdrawing a balance, etc.) may require more gas than the default provided by MetaMask. Set the gas to `100000` or more when sending a transaction. 

# List Of Stories  
## Admin Online Marketplace Management 
### Story 1
An administrator/Owner opens the application. The application should read the address and identify that the user is an admin/owner and show them only the admin related functionality like add & remove store owners as well as other admins to create a admin grp.

### How to test it
The account that deploys the contract will by default be an `admin` or `owner`. After deploying the contract, simply log into the application by selecting first account on MetaMask associated with your passphrase and admin only functionality will be shown. 

### Note
To add more admins, simply visit the home page as an `admin` and enter a desired `admin`'s address in the `Add Admin` form. After the transaction is confirmed, that account will be added in `admin` group.

### Story 2
An admin should add an address to the list of approved store owners, so if the owner of that address logs into the app, they have access to the store owner functions.

### How to test it
To test this story, first you will need to visit the application (`http://localhost:3000/`) with a **non** `admin` account, and click the `Request to be a store owner` button in the top of the page. 

Once the transaction is confirmed, login to application via `admin` account and visit the homepage again. Under the `Requested Store Owners` header, you should see the address of the store owner account that has sent the request. To make the address a `storeowner`, click the `Approve` button and submit the transaction. 

Once that transaction is confirmed, switch back to the store owner account from which request was created, and it should now display store owner functions.
